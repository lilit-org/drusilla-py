# primitives

<br>

the noctira project has a minimal set of core primitives that allows the design of to design multi-agent systems (loosely inspired by the [openai sdk](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/quickstart/)):

<br>

- [agents](agents.md): LLM (ro)bots that can be equipped with orbs and shields
- [swords](swords.md): part of the agent's gear, used to let agents take actions
- [orbs](orbs.md): part of the agent's gear, used to delegate tasks to other agents
- [shields](shields.md): part of the agent's gear, used to validate and protect the inputs from agents
- [charms](charms.md): part of the agent's gear, used to receive callbacks on lifecycle events
